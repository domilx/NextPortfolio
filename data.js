    "My name is Domenico Fernando Valentino, I am 14 years old living in Montreal, Canada. I am an electronic and computer enthusiast. I am fluent in C++, C#, Javascript, Typescript, Git, Angular, Svelte, MongoDB and my favorite, Java. My field of interest is building new desktop applications and web servers, Deep Learning and Natural Language Processing, Simple UI/UX design, and especially robots. My favourite thing to do is partake in the yearly First Robotics Competition (FRC), which is a yearly robot competition where 3 teams go head to head in a battle of scoring points. Since we put so much effort and time, we have won three times in a row with a new regional record with four prizes in one week of competition.",
